    <p> Wikepedia says:</p> 
    <blockquote>"In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and a national player of the year award.[3][4] He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. Garnett made an immediate impact with the Minnesota Timberwolves, leading them to eight consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, he led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals and won the NBA MVP Award."
